# Woman App

Project Specification: Woman App Landing Page

Summary
This project involves developing a responsive introductory landing page for Woman App, a mobile platform dedicated to women's health tracking and lifestyle management. The website will function as the central marketing hub, designed to build brand credibility and drive user acquisition by clearly presenting the mobile application's benefits and features.

Key Features
- High-impact Hero Section: Features high-resolution app interface mockups and a compelling headline defining the value proposition.
- Direct Download Links: Prominent call-to-action buttons redirecting users to the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.
- Feature Showcase: Informative sections detailing core app capabilities, such as menstrual cycle tracking, health insights, and community forums.
- Responsive Design: Optimized layout that adapts seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

Target Users
The primary audience includes women and girls seeking digital tools for reproductive health management and wellness tracking. Secondary users include potential healthcare partners and advertisers investigating the platform's legitimacy.

Core User Flows
The primary interaction flow guides a visitor from the landing page to the app store; a user lands on the site, reviews the key features, and clicks a specific store badge to download the app. A secondary flow allows users seeking support to scroll to the footer to access contact details, social media channels, or privacy policies.
